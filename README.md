# simple-PDF-outline-adder

A simple tool for adding an outline to PDF files that do not contain one using a rather simple and convenient input file
where you put a table of contents with their page numbers and section depth (i.e. whether an outline entry is a chapter,
section, subsection, etc). This tool can also modify the page offset so that the PDF numbers match those of the book. 

Useful for huge digital books (frequently legally scanned books) where
you would get easily tired of finding a page from the table of contents pages and the books' page number does
not match that of the PDF reader.

## Why does this tool exist?

Being a physics's student, it's pretty usual for me to find books that don't contain an outline in the PDF file,
which was a pet peeve whenever I want to access a certain chapter or subsection of the book,
and I didn't like the Ghostscript's way too add them, so I decided to create this simple tool for myself and then
release it for anyone that finds it useful.
